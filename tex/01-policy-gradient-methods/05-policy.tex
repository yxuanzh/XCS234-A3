In this question, we will define the conditional probability distribution over actions for both discrete and continuous environments. Implement the following functions in ~submission/policy.py~ in order to define these distributions and how we sample from them: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item ~BasePolicy::act~ 
	\item ~CategoricalPolicy::action_distribution~ 
	\item ~GaussianPolicy::__init__~ 
	\item ~GaussianPolicy::std~
	\item ~GaussianPolicy::action_distribution~ 
\end{itemize}
