\item \points{1f}

Implement the following functions in ~submission/policy_gradient.py~: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item ~PolicyGradient::update_policy~ 
	\item ~PolicyGradient::normalize_advantage~ 
\end{itemize}

This will complete the ~PolicyGradient~ class by providing a network update rule as well as the option to normalize advantages we have calculated.
